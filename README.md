# 🏠 DecentraRent

DecentraRent is a decentralized rental platform (DApp) that allows landlords and tenants to interact transparently via blockchain smart contracts. Built with a modern frontend and a Solidity-based smart contract backend, the project aims to disrupt the traditional rental system with secure, trustless agreements.

## 🔨 To-Do / In Progress

### 👥 Role-aware UI
- [ ] Tenant and Landlord role detection
- [ ] Dynamic page content based on role

### 🔐 Wallet Connection & Web3 Integration
- [ ] Add **MetaMask** login using Ethers.js or Web3.js
- [ ] Connect smart contract functions to frontend

### 🧪 Backend (Optional)
- [ ] Add data persistence layer with **Firebase** or **Supabase**
- [ ] Store listing metadata off-chain (e.g., images, pricing)

### 📱 Mobile Readiness
- [ ] Convert frontend into a **React Native** or **Expo** mobile app

### 🚀 Deployment
- [ ] Deploy frontend to **Vercel** or **Netlify**
- [ ] Confirm smart contract is deployed to testnet
- [ ] Add testnet instructions to README
